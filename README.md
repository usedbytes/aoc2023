My solutions for Advent of Code 2023

This year I've decided to use AoC as an opportunity to learn Rust, so the code
in this repo will be My First Rust Programs. As a result I expect they will be
ugly and non-idiomatic (and also take a long time to write).

If it becomes too slow for me to learn while solving, I'll switch to a language
I already know.
